## Testing & Functionality:
### Server(World):
* The world is a grid, the size should be configured using a configuration file.
* The range of visibility of objects in the world is configured in the server configuration file.
* The world is managed via a console interface on the server program, which will allow the program to accept issued commands.

### Client:
* The client program must connect to a world using the worldâ€™s IP address and port. A configuration file is used to specify the IP address and port of the server.
* A client program has the ability to launch a robot that can move around the world.
* The client can be programmed to have different makes (or models) of robots with different capability configurations.
* The robot has the ability to look around the world.
* The robot has attack and defense functionality.
